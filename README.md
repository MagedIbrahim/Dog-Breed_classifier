_CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier_

__Description__

In this project, i learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, i made important design decisions about the user experience for the app.
